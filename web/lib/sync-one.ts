/**
 * Route-facing sync entry points. The engine itself — dedup layers, dry-run
 * default, merge, HR fusion, claim → upload → finalize — lives in the
 * `hevy2garmin` package and is shared with soma. This module only binds it to
 * this app's IO:
 *
 *   store        → Postgres, via ./pending-store (postgresSyncStore)
 *   gateway      → the app's healed Garmin client (getGarminClient), lazily
 *   fetchWorkouts→ the app's Hevy key resolution (fetchAllWorkouts)
 *   hr           → ./hr-store (the hr_cache table and the durable backup)
 *   settings     → ./sync-settings (what the user saved on the Settings page)
 *
 * The settings are the point of this module now. The engine can merge and fuse
 * heart rate, and it only does either when told to, so without this the Settings
 * page would go on saving values that changed nothing (#565).
 *
 * Signatures keep the `(sql, options)` shape every route already calls.
 * dryRun still defaults to TRUE inside the engine; nothing here overrides it.
