/**
 * Tests for the merge matcher (#571).
 *
 * Every rejection rule gets its own test. The engine previously matched on an
 * exact start time, which finds nothing when a watch is started by hand, so
 * merge could never fire. These cases are the difference between "merge works"
 * and "merge silently does nothing", which is how #495 and #565 were reported.
